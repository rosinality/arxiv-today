*Optimality of Gerver's Sofa* (Jineon Baek)

> We resolve the moving sofa problem by showing that Gerver's construction with 18 curve sections attains the maximum area $2.2195\cdots$.

다른 분야이긴 합니다만 소파 옮기기 문제에 대해서 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_sofa_problem, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXfKWIZQIo4) Gerver가 제안한 소파가 최적이라는 증명이 제안됐네요. 과연 결론이 어떻게 될지 궁금하군요.

Though this is from different field, a preprint posted that claiming Gerver's sofa is optimal for moving sofa problem. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_sofa_problem, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXfKWIZQIo4). I wonder what would be final conclusion.
