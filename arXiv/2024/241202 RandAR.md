*RandAR: Decoder-only Autoregressive Visual Generation in Random Orders* (Ziqi Pang, Tianyuan Zhang, Fujun Luan, Yunze Man, Hao Tan, Kai Zhang, William T. Freeman, Yu-Xiong Wang)

> We introduce RandAR, a decoder-only visual autoregressive (AR) model capable of generating images in arbitrary token orders. Unlike previous decoder-only AR models that rely on a predefined generation order, RandAR removes this inductive bias, unlocking new capabilities in decoder-only generation. Our essential design enables random order by inserting a "position instruction token" before each image token to be predicted, representing the spatial location of the next image token. Trained on randomly permuted token sequences -- a more challenging task than fixed-order generation, RandAR achieves comparable performance to its conventional raster-order counterpart. More importantly, decoder-only transformers trained from random orders acquire new capabilities. For the efficiency bottleneck of AR models, RandAR adopts parallel decoding with KV-Cache at inference time, enjoying 2.5x acceleration without sacrificing generation quality. Additionally, RandAR supports inpainting, outpainting and resolution extrapolation in a zero-shot manner. We hope RandAR inspires new directions for decoder-only visual generation models and broadens their applications across diverse scenarios. Our project page is at https://rand-ar.github.io/.

랜덤 순서 토큰 예측으로 Autoregressive 이미지 생성. (https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00776) 랜덤 위치의 토큰을 예측할 수 있기에 병렬적으로 여러 토큰을 예측할 수도 있고 인페인팅 등의 과제에 대해서도 잘 맞는군요. Autoregressive 이미지 생성을 한다면 고려할만한 선택이 되어가는 것 같네요.

Autoregressive image generation with random order token prediction. (https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00776) As model can predict tokens in random positions it possible to predict multiple tokens in parallel, and fit well tasks like inpainting. I think this approach is became worth considering if you want to do autoregressive image generation.
