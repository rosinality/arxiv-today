*Course-Correction: Safety Alignment Using Synthetic Preferences* (Rongwu Xu, Yishuo Cai, Zhenhong Zhou, Renjie Gu, Haiqin Weng, Yan Liu, Tianwei Zhang, Wei Xu, Han Qiu)

> The risk of harmful content generated by large language models (LLMs) becomes a critical concern. This paper presents a systematic study on assessing and improving LLMs' capability to perform the task of course-correction, i.e., the model can steer away from generating harmful content autonomously. To start with, we introduce the C^2-Eval benchmark for quantitative assessment and analyze 10 popular LLMs, revealing varying proficiency of current safety-tuned LLMs in course-correction. To improve, we propose fine-tuning LLMs with preference learning, emphasizing the preference for timely course-correction. Using an automated pipeline, we create C^2-Syn, a synthetic dataset with 750K pairwise preferences, to teach models the concept of timely course-correction through data-driven preference learning. Experiments on 2 LLMs, Llama2-Chat 7B and Qwen2 7B, show that our method effectively enhances course-correction skills without affecting general performance. Additionally, it effectively improves LLMs' safety, particularly in resisting jailbreak attacks.

이쪽도 Rewriting 기반 Synthetic Feedback이네요. Unsafe한 응답을 하던 중에도 Safe한 응답으로 방향을 바꾸는 능력과 관련된 문제입니다. Unsafe한 응답을 쪼개고 LLM으로 응답을 Safe하게 Rewriting한 다음 더 이른 시점의 응답을 Rewriting한 결과를 선호하도록 했네요.
