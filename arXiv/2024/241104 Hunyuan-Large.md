> In this paper, we introduce Hunyuan-Large, which is currently the largest open-source Transformer-based mixture of experts model, with a total of 389 billion parameters and 52 billion activation parameters, capable of handling up to 256K tokens. We conduct a thorough evaluation of Hunyuan-Large's superior performance across various benchmarks including language understanding and generation, logical reasoning, mathematical problem-solving, coding, long-context, and aggregated tasks, where it outperforms LLama3.1-70B and exhibits comparable performance when compared to the significantly larger LLama3.1-405B model. Key practice of Hunyuan-Large include large-scale synthetic data that is orders larger than in previous literature, a mixed expert routing strategy, a key-value cache compression technique, and an expert-specific learning rate strategy. Additionally, we also investigate the scaling laws and learning rate schedule of mixture of experts models, providing valuable insights and guidances for future model development and optimization. The code and checkpoints of Hunyuan-Large are released to facilitate future innovations and applications.

텐센트의 52B Activated 389B Weight MoE 모델. 웹 데이터를 Instruction으로 만든 합성 데이터를 1.5T 사용했군요. KV Cache 공유, 1 Shared Expert, 16 Expert 중 Top-1 Expert 사용. Token Dropping 대신 Capacity가 남는 Expert로 라우팅하는 방법 사용. 추가적으로 MoE에 대한 Scaling Law 추정. 52B/7T 학습이라는 세팅 자체가 Chinchilla Optimal에 가깝군요. (58B, 5.6T)

<english>
52B Activated 389B Weight MoE model from Tencent. They employed 1.5T synthetic data made by turning web corpus into instruction dataset. KV cache sharing, 1 shared experts, and top-1 expert among 16 experts. Instead of token dropping they routed dropped token into expert which has capacity budget. Additionally they estimated scaling law for MoE, and 52B/7T training is closed to chinchilla optimal. (58B, 5.6T)
