*AlphaZero Neural Scaling and Zipf's Law: a Tale of Board Games and Power Laws* (Oren Neumann, Claudius Gros)

> Neural scaling laws are observed in a range of domains, to date with no clear understanding of why they occur. Recent theories suggest that loss power laws arise from Zipf's law, a power law observed in domains like natural language. One theory suggests that language scaling laws emerge when Zipf-distributed task quanta are learned in descending order of frequency. In this paper we examine power-law scaling in AlphaZero, a reinforcement learning algorithm, using a theory of language-model scaling. We find that game states in training and inference data scale with Zipf's law, which is known to arise from the tree structure of the environment, and examine the correlation between scaling-law and Zipf's-law exponents. In agreement with quanta scaling theory, we find that agents optimize state loss in descending order of frequency, even though this order scales inversely with modelling complexity. We also find that inverse scaling, the failure of models to improve with size, is correlated with unusual Zipf curves where end-game states are among the most frequent states. We show evidence that larger models shift their focus to these less-important states, sacrificing their understanding of important early-game states.
