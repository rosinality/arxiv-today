*FLAME: Factuality-Aware Alignment for Large Language Models* (Sheng-Chieh Lin, Luyu Gao, Barlas Oguz, Wenhan Xiong, Jimmy Lin, Wen-tau Yih, Xilun Chen)

> Alignment is a standard procedure to fine-tune pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to follow natural language instructions and serve as helpful AI assistants. We have observed, however, that the conventional alignment process fails to enhance the factual accuracy of LLMs, and often leads to the generation of more false facts (i.e. hallucination). In this paper, we study how to make the LLM alignment process more factual, by first identifying factors that lead to hallucination in both alignment steps:\ supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). In particular, we find that training the LLM on new knowledge or unfamiliar texts can encourage hallucination. This makes SFT less factual as it trains on human labeled data that may be novel to the LLM. Furthermore, reward functions used in standard RL can also encourage hallucination, because it guides the LLM to provide more helpful responses on a diverse set of instructions, often preferring longer and more detailed responses. Based on these observations, we propose factuality-aware alignment, comprised of factuality-aware SFT and factuality-aware RL through direct preference optimization. Experiments show that our proposed factuality-aware alignment guides LLMs to output more factual responses while maintaining instruction-following capability.

할루시네이션 억제를 위한 튜닝 전략. SFT 단계에서 모델에 없는 정보로 튜닝하는 것을 막기 위해 사실에 관련된 지식이 필요한 지시에 대해서는 Few-shot으로 모델이 생성한 출력을 SFT 데이터로 활용했습니다. DPO 단계에서는 SFT 모델로 Preference Pair를 생성하되 원자적인 사실로 쪼갠 다음 Retrieval Augmentation으로 판단하게 하는 방식을 썼네요.

Few-shot으로 모델이 생성한 응답 위에 Preference Annotation으로 정렬하는 전략도 꽤 괜찮은 접근이 아닌가 싶습니다.
