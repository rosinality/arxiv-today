*NExT: Teaching Large Language Models to Reason about Code Execution* (Ansong Ni, Miltiadis Allamanis, Arman Cohan, Yinlin Deng, Kensen Shi, Charles Sutton, Pengcheng Yin)

> A fundamental skill among human developers is the ability to understand and reason about program execution. As an example, a programmer can mentally simulate code execution in natural language to debug and repair code (aka. rubber duck debugging). However, large language models (LLMs) of code are typically trained on the surface textual form of programs, thus may lack a semantic understanding of how programs execute at run-time. To address this issue, we propose NExT, a method to teach LLMs to inspect the execution traces of programs (variable states of executed lines) and reason about their run-time behavior through chain-of-thought (CoT) rationales. Specifically, NExT uses self-training to bootstrap a synthetic training set of execution-aware rationales that lead to correct task solutions (e.g., fixed programs) without laborious manual annotation. Experiments on program repair tasks based on MBPP and HumanEval demonstrate that NExT improves the fix rate of a PaLM 2 model, by 26.1% and 14.3% absolute, respectively, with significantly improved rationale quality as verified by automated metrics and human raters. Our model can also generalize to scenarios where program traces are absent at test-time.

코드를 고치는 방법을 LLM에게 학습시키기. 자연어 프롬프트, 코드, 테스트, 실행 과정에 대한 Trace를 주고 모델에게 추론과 수정한 코드를 생성하게 합니다. 이 코드를 유닛 테스트로 평가해서 올바른 추론만 걸러내서 학습시키는 방법입니다.

자연어 텍스트에는 모델의 추론에 필요한 행간의 의미가 빠져 있다는 이야기를 많이 하는데 코드는 그런 이런 Trace를 통해 행간을 비교적 채워넣을 수 있겠다 싶네요.
