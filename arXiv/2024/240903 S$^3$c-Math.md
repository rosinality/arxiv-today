*S$^3$c-Math: Spontaneous Step-level Self-correction Makes Large Language Models Better Mathematical Reasoners* (Yuchen Yan, Jin Jiang, Yang Liu, Yixin Cao, Xin Xu, Mengdi zhang, Xunliang Cai, Jian Shao)

> Self-correction is a novel method that can stimulate the potential reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). It involves detecting and correcting errors during the inference process when LLMs solve reasoning problems. However, recent works do not regard self-correction as a spontaneous and intrinsic capability of LLMs. Instead, such correction is achieved through post-hoc generation, external knowledge introduction, multi-model collaboration, and similar techniques. In this paper, we propose a series of mathematical LLMs called S^3c-Math, which are able to perform Spontaneous Step-level Self-correction for Mathematical reasoning. This capability helps LLMs to recognize whether their ongoing inference tends to contain errors and simultaneously correct these errors to produce a more reliable response. We proposed a method, which employs a step-level sampling approach to construct step-wise self-correction data for achieving such ability. Additionally, we implement a training strategy that uses above constructed data to equip LLMs with spontaneous step-level self-correction capacities. Our data and methods have been demonstrated to be effective across various foundation LLMs, consistently showing significant progress in evaluations on GSM8K, MATH, and other mathematical benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce the spontaneous step-level self-correction ability of LLMs in mathematical reasoning.

오류를 자기 수정하도록 LLM을 학습시키기. 일단 최종 답안을 사용할 수 있다는 것이 전제이긴 합니다. 얼마 전 나온 Physics of Language Models 2.2를 (https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16293) 떠올리게 하네요.
