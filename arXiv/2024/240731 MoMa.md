*MoMa: Efficient Early-Fusion Pre-training with Mixture of Modality-Aware Experts* (Xi Victoria Lin, Akshat Shrivastava, Liang Luo, Srinivasan Iyer, Mike Lewis, Gargi Gosh, Luke Zettlemoyer, Armen Aghajanyan)

> We introduce MoMa, a novel modality-aware mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture designed for pre-training mixed-modal, early-fusion language models. MoMa processes images and text in arbitrary sequences by dividing expert modules into modality-specific groups. These groups exclusively process designated tokens while employing learned routing within each group to maintain semantically informed adaptivity. Our empirical results reveal substantial pre-training efficiency gains through this modality-specific parameter allocation. Under a 1-trillion-token training budget, the MoMa 1.4B model, featuring 4 text experts and 4 image experts, achieves impressive FLOPs savings: 3.7x overall, with 2.6x for text and 5.2x for image processing compared to a compute-equivalent dense baseline, measured by pre-training loss. This outperforms the standard expert-choice MoE with 8 mixed-modal experts, which achieves 3x overall FLOPs savings (3x for text, 2.8x for image). Combining MoMa with mixture-of-depths (MoD) further improves pre-training FLOPs savings to 4.2x overall (text: 3.4x, image: 5.3x), although this combination hurts performance in causal inference due to increased sensitivity to router accuracy. These results demonstrate MoMa's potential to significantly advance the efficiency of mixed-modal, early-fusion language model pre-training, paving the way for more resource-efficient and capable multimodal AI systems.

Multi Modal 모델에 대한 MoE 적용. 각 모달리티별로 구분된 Expert 그룹을 사용하고 Mixture of Depth (https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02258) 적용, 각 모달리티에 1개 Expert를 부여해서 학습을 시작한 다음 Sparse Upcycling 하는 방법을 사용했습니다. 추가로 Expert Choice를 사용하면서 Autoregressive 상황에 적절하도록 조정한 부분도 있네요. 굉장히 흥미롭습니다.
