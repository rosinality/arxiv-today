*InfiMM-WebMath-40B: Advancing Multimodal Pre-Training for Enhanced Mathematical Reasoning* (Xiaotian Han, Yiren Jian, Xuefeng Hu, Haogeng Liu, Yiqi Wang, Qihang Fan, Yuang Ai, Huaibo Huang, Ran He, Zhenheng Yang, Quanzeng You)

> Pre-training on large-scale, high-quality datasets is crucial for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), especially in specialized domains such as mathematics. Despite the recognized importance, the Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) field currently lacks a comprehensive open-source pre-training dataset specifically designed for mathematical reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce InfiMM-WebMath-40B, a high-quality dataset of interleaved image-text documents. It comprises 24 million web pages, 85 million associated image URLs, and 40 billion text tokens, all meticulously extracted and filtered from CommonCrawl. We provide a detailed overview of our data collection and processing pipeline. To demonstrate the robustness of InfiMM-WebMath-40B, we conducted evaluations in both text-only and multimodal settings. Our evaluations on text-only benchmarks show that, despite utilizing only 40 billion tokens, our dataset significantly enhances the performance of our 1.3B model, delivering results comparable to DeepSeekMath-1.3B, which uses 120 billion tokens for the same model size. Nevertheless, with the introduction of our multi-modal math pre-training dataset, our models set a new state-of-the-art among open-source models on multi-modal math benchmarks such as MathVerse and We-Math. We release our data at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Infi-MM/InfiMM-WebMath-40B.

Common Crawl에서 수집한 수학 데이터. Common Crawl에서 수학 데이터를 수집하는 사례들은 증가했지만 OpenWebMath 이후로 공개된 수학 데이터는 별로 없었는데 드디어 하나가 등장했군요. 거기에 Interleaved 이미지를 고려한 Multimodal 데이터네요.
