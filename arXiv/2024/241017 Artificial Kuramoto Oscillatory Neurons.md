*Artificial Kuramoto Oscillatory Neurons* (Takeru Miyato, Sindy Löwe, Andreas Geiger, Max Welling)

> It has long been known in both neuroscience and AI that ``binding'' between neurons leads to a form of competitive learning where representations are compressed in order to represent more abstract concepts in deeper layers of the network. More recently, it was also hypothesized that dynamic (spatiotemporal) representations play an important role in both neuroscience and AI. Building on these ideas, we introduce Artificial Kuramoto Oscillatory Neurons (AKOrN) as a dynamical alternative to threshold units, which can be combined with arbitrary connectivity designs such as fully connected, convolutional, or attentive mechanisms. Our generalized Kuramoto updates bind neurons together through their synchronization dynamics. We show that this idea provides performance improvements across a wide spectrum of tasks such as unsupervised object discovery, adversarial robustness, calibrated uncertainty quantification, and reasoning. We believe that these empirical results show the importance of rethinking our assumptions at the most basic neuronal level of neural representation, and in particular show the importance of dynamical representations.

쿠라모토 모형이라면 동기화 현상을 다루는 그 모형이군요. 동기화 현상을 모델링하는 것으로 스도쿠 같은 문제를 풀 수 있었다는 결과. KAN처럼 한동안 이 모델을 여기저기 적용해봤다는 사례가 많이 나오겠군요.

여담이지만 Takeru Miyato는 Spectral Normalization의 그 Takeru Miyato네요. 반가운 이름이군요.

Kuramoto models is a model which explains synchronization behavior. So by incorporating synchronization phenomena it was able to solve problems like sudoku. I think there will be many ancedote that applies this model to various problems, just like KAN.

By the way, Takure Miyato is the author of spectral normlization.
