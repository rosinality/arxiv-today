> We introduce StableLM 2 1.6B, the first in a new generation of our language model series. In this technical report, we present in detail the data and training procedure leading to the base and instruction-tuned versions of StableLM 2 1.6B. The weights for both models are available via Hugging Face for anyone to download and use. The report contains thorough evaluations of these models, including zero- and few-shot benchmarks, multilingual benchmarks, and the MT benchmark focusing on multi-turn dialogues. At the time of publishing this report, StableLM 2 1.6B was the state-of-the-art open model under 2B parameters by a significant margin. Given its appealing small size, we also provide throughput measurements on a number of edge devices. In addition, we open source several quantized checkpoints and provide their performance metrics compared to the original model.

1.6B 2T 학습 모델이군요. The Pile 스타일로 데이터셋을 큐레이션 했네요. Multilingual, Instruction 데이터 사용과 Cosine과 Inverse-Sqrt 스케쥴을 붙여 만든 Infinite Learning Rate Scheduling + Cooldown이 특징이겠네요.
