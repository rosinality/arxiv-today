> The remarkable multimodal capabilities and interactive experience of GPT-4o underscore their necessity in practical applications, yet open-source models rarely excel in both areas. In this paper, we introduce VITA, the first-ever open-source Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) adept at simultaneous processing and analysis of Video, Image, Text, and Audio modalities, and meanwhile has an advanced multimodal interactive experience. Starting from Mixtral 8x7B as a language foundation, we expand its Chinese vocabulary followed by bilingual instruction tuning. We further endow the language model with visual and audio capabilities through two-stage multi-task learning of multimodal alignment and instruction tuning. VITA demonstrates robust foundational capabilities of multilingual, vision, and audio understanding, as evidenced by its strong performance across a range of both unimodal and multimodal benchmarks. Beyond foundational capabilities, we have made considerable progress in enhancing the natural multimodal human-computer interaction experience. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to exploit non-awakening interaction and audio interrupt in MLLM. VITA is the first step for the open-source community to explore the seamless integration of multimodal understanding and interaction. While there is still lots of work to be done on VITA to get close to close-source counterparts, we hope that its role as a pioneer can serve as a cornerstone for subsequent research.

Omni Modal 모델에 대한 시도들도 슬슬 등장하는군요. 실제 사람과의 Interaction을 고려하다 보니 음성으로 Instruction이 들어오는 경우와 노이즈인 경우에 대한 모드 구분, 그리고 음성을 생성하는 중에 사용자가 개입하는 경우에 대해 대응하기 위한 메커니즘을 어떻게 구현할 것인가 등등이 문제가 되는군요.

가장 간결하고 단순하게 이 문제에 접근하는 방법과 (되도록이면 From Scratch로) Omni Modal 학습을 할 수 있는 방법을 설계하는 것이 흥미로운 지점이 아닐까 싶습니다.
