*Cleaner Pretraining Corpus Curation with Neural Web Scraping* (Zhipeng Xu, Zhenghao Liu, Yukun Yan, Zhiyuan Liu, Chenyan Xiong, Ge Yu)

> The web contains large-scale, diverse, and abundant information to satisfy the information-seeking needs of humans. Through meticulous data collection, preprocessing, and curation, webpages can be used as a fundamental data resource for language model pretraining. However, when confronted with the progressively revolutionized and intricate nature of webpages, rule-based/feature-based web scrapers are becoming increasingly inadequate. This paper presents a simple, fast, and effective Neural web Scraper (NeuScraper) to help extract primary and clean text contents from webpages. Experimental results show that NeuScraper surpasses the baseline scrapers by achieving more than a 20% improvement, demonstrating its potential in extracting higher-quality data to facilitate the language model pretraining. All of the code is available at https://github.com/OpenMatch/NeuScraper.

모델 기반 HTML Extractor. Trafilatura 같은 Extractor와 비교하고 있는데 코퍼스 전반의 측면에서 CCNet 같은 WET를 사용하는 시도와의 차이는 어떨지 궁금하네요.
