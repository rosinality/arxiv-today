*Fluid: Scaling Autoregressive Text-to-image Generative Models with Continuous Tokens* (Lijie Fan, Tianhong Li, Siyang Qin, Yuanzhen Li, Chen Sun, Michael Rubinstein, Deqing Sun, Kaiming He, Yonglong Tian)

> Scaling up autoregressive models in vision has not proven as beneficial as in large language models. In this work, we investigate this scaling problem in the context of text-to-image generation, focusing on two critical factors: whether models use discrete or continuous tokens, and whether tokens are generated in a random or fixed raster order using BERT- or GPT-like transformer architectures. Our empirical results show that, while all models scale effectively in terms of validation loss, their evaluation performance -- measured by FID, GenEval score, and visual quality -- follows different trends. Models based on continuous tokens achieve significantly better visual quality than those using discrete tokens. Furthermore, the generation order and attention mechanisms significantly affect the GenEval score: random-order models achieve notably better GenEval scores compared to raster-order models. Inspired by these findings, we train Fluid, a random-order autoregressive model on continuous tokens. Fluid 10.5B model achieves a new state-of-the-art zero-shot FID of 6.16 on MS-COCO 30K, and 0.69 overall score on the GenEval benchmark. We hope our findings and results will encourage future efforts to further bridge the scaling gap between vision and language models.

Discrete Token vs Continuous Token + Diffusion, Next Token Prediction vs Masked Autoregression에 대한 Scaling 실험. 이전에 나온 연구와 유사한 세팅입니다. (https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11838)

결과적으로는 Masked Autoregression + Contiuous Token Diffusion이 좋은 결과를 냈군요. 이 문제는 여전히 탐색할만한 것이 많다는 느낌입니다.

Scaling experiments on discrete token vs continuous token + diffusion, and next token prediction vs masked autoregression. It is similar setting with previous study. (https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11838)

For the result, masked autoregression + continuous token diffusion reaches best performance. I think there are many areas to explore for this problem.
