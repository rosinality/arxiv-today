*Learning to Reason as Action Abstractions with Scalable Mid-Training RL* (Shenao Zhang, Donghan Yu, Yihao Feng, Bowen Jin, Zhaoran Wang, John Peebles, Zirui Wang)

> Large language models excel with reinforcement learning (RL), but fully unlocking this potential requires a mid-training stage. An effective mid-training phase should identify a compact set of useful actions and enable fast selection among them through online RL. We formalize this intuition by presenting the first theoretical result on how mid-training shapes post-training: it characterizes an action subspace that minimizes both the value approximation error from pruning and the RL error during subsequent planning. Our analysis reveals two key determinants of mid-training effectiveness: pruning efficiency, which shapes the prior of the initial RL policy, and its impact on RL convergence, which governs the extent to which that policy can be improved via online interactions. These results suggest that mid-training is most effective when the decision space is compact and the effective horizon is short, highlighting the importance of operating in the space of action abstractions rather than primitive actions. Building on these insights, we propose Reasoning as Action Abstractions (RA3), a scalable mid-training algorithm. Specifically, we derive a sequential variational lower bound and optimize it by iteratively discovering temporally-consistent latent structures via RL, followed by fine-tuning on the bootstrapped data. Experiments on code generation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Across multiple base models, RA3 improves the average performance on HumanEval and MBPP by 8 and 4 points over the base model and the next-token prediction baseline. Furthermore, RA3 achieves faster convergence and higher asymptotic performance in RLVR on HumanEval+, MBPP+, LiveCodeBench, and Codeforces.

This is very interesting! Basically synthesizing rationale on the corpus for mid-training using likelihood of rest sequences as a reward. But this work penalizes for unnecessary reasoning steps, thus inserts rationale only when it is beneficial.
