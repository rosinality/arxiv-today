*Stable and Efficient Single-Rollout RL for Multimodal Reasoning* (Rui Liu, Dian Yu, Lei Ke, Haolin Liu, Yujun Zhou, Zhenwen Liang, Haitao Mi, Pratap Tokekar, Dong Yu)

> Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has become a key paradigm to improve the reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, prevalent group-based algorithms such as GRPO require multi-rollout sampling for each prompt. While more efficient single-rollout variants have recently been explored in text-only settings, we find that they suffer from severe instability in multimodal contexts, often leading to training collapse. To address this training efficiency-stability trade-off, we introduce $\textbf{MSSR}$ (Multimodal Stabilized Single-Rollout), a group-free RLVR framework that achieves both stable optimization and effective multimodal reasoning performance. MSSR achieves this via an entropy-based advantage-shaping mechanism that adaptively regularizes advantage magnitudes, preventing collapse and maintaining training stability. While such mechanisms have been used in group-based RLVR, we show that in the multimodal single-rollout setting they are not merely beneficial but essential for stability. In in-distribution evaluations, MSSR demonstrates superior training compute efficiency, achieving similar validation accuracy to the group-based baseline with half the training steps. When trained for the same number of steps, MSSR's performance surpasses the group-based baseline and shows consistent generalization improvements across five diverse reasoning-intensive benchmarks. Together, these results demonstrate that MSSR enables stable, compute-efficient, and effective RLVR for complex multimodal reasoning tasks.

Single rollout RL for multimodal RL. It is similar to the previous approach of single rollout RL (https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13232) but they were able to stabilize this only after applying advantage shaping with an entropy bonus.
