> Recently, studies exemplified by Hyper-Connections (HC) have extended the ubiquitous residual connection paradigm established over the past decade by expanding the residual stream width and diversifying connectivity patterns. While yielding substantial performance gains, this diversification fundamentally compromises the identity mapping property intrinsic to the residual connection, which causes severe training instability and restricted scalability, and additionally incurs notable memory access overhead. To address these challenges, we propose Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections (mHC), a general framework that projects the residual connection space of HC onto a specific manifold to restore the identity mapping property, while incorporating rigorous infrastructure optimization to ensure efficiency. Empirical experiments demonstrate that mHC is effective for training at scale, offering tangible performance improvements and superior scalability. We anticipate that mHC, as a flexible and practical extension of HC, will contribute to a deeper understanding of topological architecture design and suggest promising directions for the evolution of foundational models.

DeepSeek이 Hyper Connections의 (https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19606) Signal Propagation과 인프라 지원을 개선. Skip Connection은 (이전에 있었던 많은 개선 시도를 고려하면) 가장 질문이 제기되지 않는 아키텍처 선택이라고 생각. 어쩌면 DeepSeek의 다음 모델에서는 새로운 아키텍처를 기대해도 될 지도?

DeepSeek improved the signal propagation of Hyper Connections (https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19606) and infrastructure support. I think skip connections are the most unquestioned architectural choice considering previous attempts to improve it. Maybe we can expect a novel architecture from the next release of DeepSeek?
