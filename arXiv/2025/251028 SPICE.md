*SPICE: Self-Play In Corpus Environments Improves Reasoning* (Bo Liu, Chuanyang Jin, Seungone Kim, Weizhe Yuan, Wenting Zhao, Ilia Kulikov, Xian Li, Sainbayar Sukhbaatar, Jack Lanchantin, Jason Weston)

> Self-improving systems require environmental interaction for continuous adaptation. We introduce SPICE (Self-Play In Corpus Environments), a reinforcement learning framework where a single model acts in two roles: a Challenger that mines documents from a large corpus to generate diverse reasoning tasks, and a Reasoner that solves them. Through adversarial dynamics, the Challenger creates an automatic curriculum at the frontier of the Reasoner's capability, while corpus grounding provides the rich, near-inexhaustible external signal necessary for sustained improvement. Unlike existing ungrounded self-play methods that offer more limited benefits, SPICE achieves consistent gains across mathematical (+8.9%) and general reasoning (+9.8%) benchmarks on multiple model families. Our analysis reveals how document grounding is a key ingredient in SPICE to continuously generate its own increasingly challenging goals and achieve them, enabling sustained self-improvement.

추론자의 정답률의 분산을 최대화하도록 코퍼스에서 QA 페어를 만들고 추론자가 풀도록 학습. Noam Brown이 언급한 50% 정답률을 타겟하는 게임과 정확히 같은 세팅 (https://x.com/polynoamial/status/1980697004658556972).

Build a QA pair from the corpus that maximizes the reasoner's variance of correctness, and let the reasoner solve it. This is exactly a game targeting 50% correctness that Noam Brown mentioned (https://x.com/polynoamial/status/1980697004658556972).
