*VerifyBench: Benchmarking Reference-based Reward Systems for Large Language Models* (Yuchen Yan, Jin Jiang, Zhenbang Ren, Yijun Li, Xudong Cai, Yang Liu, Xin Xu, Mengdi Zhang, Jian Shao, Yongliang Shen, Jun Xiao, Yueting Zhuang)

> Large reasoning models such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek-R1 have achieved remarkable performance in the domain of reasoning. A key component of their training is the incorporation of verifiable rewards within reinforcement learning (RL). However, existing reward benchmarks do not evaluate reference-based reward systems, leaving researchers with limited understanding of the accuracy of verifiers used in RL. In this paper, we introduce two benchmarks, VerifyBench and VerifyBench-Hard, designed to assess the performance of reference-based reward systems. These benchmarks are constructed through meticulous data collection and curation, followed by careful human annotation to ensure high quality. Current models still show considerable room for improvement on both VerifyBench and VerifyBench-Hard, especially smaller-scale models. Furthermore, we conduct a thorough and comprehensive analysis of evaluation results, offering insights for understanding and developing reference-based reward systems. Our proposed benchmarks serve as effective tools for guiding the development of verifier accuracy and the reasoning capabilities of models trained via RL in reasoning tasks.

정답 사용 모델 기반 Verifier를 이제 다들 채택한 것 같군요. 벤치마크도 나왔습니다.

It seems that everybody already adopted model based verifier with references. This is a benchmark for that.
