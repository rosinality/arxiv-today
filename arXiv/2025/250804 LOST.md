*LOST: Low-rank and Sparse Pre-training for Large Language Models* (Jiaxi Li, Lu Yin, Li Shen, Jinjin Xu, Liwu Xu, Tianjin Huang, Wenwu Wang, Shiwei Liu, Xilu Wang)

> While large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks, their massive scale incurs prohibitive computational and memory costs for pre-training from scratch. Recent studies have investigated the use of low-rank parameterization as a means of reducing model size and training cost. In this context, sparsity is often employed as a complementary technique to recover important information lost in low-rank compression by capturing salient features in the residual space. However, existing approaches typically combine low-rank and sparse components in a simplistic or ad hoc manner, often resulting in undesirable performance degradation compared to full-rank training. In this paper, we propose \textbf{LO}w-rank and \textbf{S}parse pre-\textbf{T}raining (\textbf{LOST}) for LLMs, a novel method that ingeniously integrates low-rank and sparse structures to enable effective training of LLMs from scratch under strict efficiency constraints. LOST applies singular value decomposition to weight matrices, preserving the dominant low-rank components, while allocating the remaining singular values to construct channel-wise sparse components to complement the expressiveness of low-rank training. We evaluate LOST on LLM pretraining ranging from 60M to 7B parameters. Our experiments show that LOST achieves competitive or superior performance compared to full-rank models, while significantly reducing both memory and compute overhead.

SVD와 추가 채널 선택을 결합한 Low-rank Pretraining. 이 계통 연구도 나온지 꽤 됐는데 실제 대규모에서 작동하는지는 여전히 문제.

Low-rank pretraining with SVD and additional channel selection. This line of research appeared quite long ago, but does this work at scale?
