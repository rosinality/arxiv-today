*DC-AE 1.5: Accelerating Diffusion Model Convergence with Structured Latent Space* (Junyu Chen, Dongyun Zou, Wenkun He, Junsong Chen, Enze Xie, Song Han, Han Cai)

> We present DC-AE 1.5, a new family of deep compression autoencoders for high-resolution diffusion models. Increasing the autoencoder's latent channel number is a highly effective approach for improving its reconstruction quality. However, it results in slow convergence for diffusion models, leading to poorer generation quality despite better reconstruction quality. This issue limits the quality upper bound of latent diffusion models and hinders the employment of autoencoders with higher spatial compression ratios. We introduce two key innovations to address this challenge: i) Structured Latent Space, a training-based approach to impose a desired channel-wise structure on the latent space with front latent channels capturing object structures and latter latent channels capturing image details; ii) Augmented Diffusion Training, an augmented diffusion training strategy with additional diffusion training objectives on object latent channels to accelerate convergence. With these techniques, DC-AE 1.5 delivers faster convergence and better diffusion scaling results than DC-AE. On ImageNet 512x512, DC-AE-1.5-f64c128 delivers better image generation quality than DC-AE-f32c32 while being 4x faster. Code: https://github.com/dc-ai-projects/DC-Gen.

Autoencoder의 Latent Space에 구조를 부여하는 것으로 고채널 고압축을 실현. 흥미롭게도 채널 마스킹을 사용해서 구조를 부여. Latent Space를 사용하는 것이기 때문에 이런 구조는 중요할 수 있음. Antialiasing처럼.

Achieving high-channel high-compression autoencoders by imposing structure on the latent space. Interestingly they use channel masking to do it. Since the latent space is used for downstream tasks structures could be important. (i.e. antialiasing?)
