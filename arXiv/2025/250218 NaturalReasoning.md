*NaturalReasoning: Reasoning in the Wild with 2.8M Challenging Questions* (Weizhe Yuan, Jane Yu, Song Jiang, Karthik Padthe, Yang Li, Dong Wang, Ilia Kulikov, Kyunghyun Cho, Yuandong Tian, Jason E Weston, Xian Li)

> Scaling reasoning capabilities beyond traditional domains such as math and coding is hindered by the lack of diverse and high-quality questions. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a scalable approach for generating diverse and challenging reasoning questions, accompanied by reference answers. We present NaturalReasoning, a comprehensive dataset comprising 2.8 million questions that span multiple domains, including STEM fields (e.g., Physics, Computer Science), Economics, Social Sciences, and more. We demonstrate the utility of the questions in NaturalReasoning through knowledge distillation experiments which show that NaturalReasoning can effectively elicit and transfer reasoning capabilities from a strong teacher model. Furthermore, we demonstrate that NaturalReasoning is also effective for unsupervised self-training using external reward models or self-rewarding.

웹 코퍼스에서 질문과 응답을 추출하기 위한 방법. 이전에도 중요한 방향이었지만 정답을 활용한 추론 능력이 중요해진 상황에서 더 중요해졌다고 할 수 있겠네요.
