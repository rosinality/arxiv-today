> Mixture of Experts (MoE) models have emerged as a promising paradigm for scaling language models efficiently by activating only a subset of parameters for each input token. In this report, we present dots.llm1, a large-scale MoE model that activates 14B parameters out of a total of 142B parameters, delivering performance on par with state-of-the-art models while reducing training and inference costs. Leveraging our meticulously crafted and efficient data processing pipeline, dots.llm1 achieves performance comparable to Qwen2.5-72B after pretraining on 11.2T high-quality tokens and post-training to fully unlock its capabilities. Notably, no synthetic data is used during pretraining. To foster further research, we open-source intermediate training checkpoints at every one trillion tokens, providing valuable insights into the learning dynamics of large language models.
