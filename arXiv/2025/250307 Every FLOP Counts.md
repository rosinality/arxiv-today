> In this technical report, we tackle the challenges of training large-scale Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, focusing on overcoming cost inefficiency and resource limitations prevalent in such systems. To address these issues, we present two differently sized MoE large language models (LLMs), namely Ling-Lite and Ling-Plus (referred to as "Bailing" in Chinese, spelled B\v{a}il\'ing in Pinyin). Ling-Lite contains 16.8 billion parameters with 2.75 billion activated parameters, while Ling-Plus boasts 290 billion parameters with 28.8 billion activated parameters. Both models exhibit comparable performance to leading industry benchmarks. This report offers actionable insights to improve the efficiency and accessibility of AI development in resource-constrained settings, promoting more scalable and sustainable technologies. Specifically, to reduce training costs for large-scale MoE models, we propose innovative methods for (1) optimization of model architecture and training processes, (2) refinement of training anomaly handling, and (3) enhancement of model evaluation efficiency. Additionally, leveraging high-quality data generated from knowledge graphs, our models demonstrate superior capabilities in tool use compared to other models. Ultimately, our experimental findings demonstrate that a 300B MoE LLM can be effectively trained on lower-performance devices while achieving comparable performance to models of a similar scale, including dense and MoE models. Compared to high-performance devices, utilizing a lower-specification hardware system during the pre-training phase demonstrates significant cost savings, reducing computing costs by approximately 20%.

29B Activated 290B Total Weight 9T 학습 MoE. 놀랍게도 서로 다른 디바이스를 사용하는 클러스터를 옮겨다니면서 Local SGD 기반 방법으로 학습했네요. (https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07210) MoE에 대해서도 Scaling Law 등 흥미로운 점들이 많습니다.

29B activated 290B total weight MoE trained on 9T tokens. Surprisingly they migrated training run between heterogeneous clusters using a method based on local SGD (https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07210). There are a lot of interesting points on MoE like scaling law estimation.
