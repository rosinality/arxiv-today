*MAGA: MAssive Genre-Audience Reformulation to Pretraining Corpus Expansion* (Xintong Hao, Ke Shen, Chenggang Li)

> Despite the remarkable capabilities of large language models across various tasks, their continued scaling faces a critical challenge: the scarcity of high-quality pretraining data. While model architectures continue to evolve, the natural language data struggles to scale up. To tackle this bottleneck, we propose \textbf{MA}ssive \textbf{G}enre-\textbf{A}udience~(MAGA) reformulation method, which systematic synthesizes diverse, contextually-rich pretraining data from existing corpus. This work makes three main contributions: (1) We propose MAGA reformulation method, a lightweight and scalable approach for pretraining corpus expansion, and build a 770B tokens MAGACorpus. (2) We evaluate MAGACorpus with different data budget scaling strategies, demonstrating consistent improvements across various model sizes (134M-13B), establishing the necessity for next-generation large-scale synthetic pretraining language models. (3) Through comprehensive analysis, we investigate prompt engineering's impact on synthetic training collapse and reveal limitations in conventional collapse detection metrics using validation losses. Our work shows that MAGA can substantially expand training datasets while maintaining quality, offering a reliably pathway for scaling models beyond data limitations.

재작성으로 프리트레이닝 코퍼스의 증폭을 시도. LLM을 사용해 프리트레이닝 코퍼스를 확장하는 것은 꽤 흥미로운 방향이라고 생각합니다. 그렇지만 이 논문에서 지적하는 것처럼 성공적인 레시피를 찾기 위해선 상당히 조심스러워야 하겠죠.

Expanding pretraining corpus using rewriting. I think expansion of pretraining corpus using LLM is interesting research direction. But, as pointed in the paper, we should be cautious to find successful recipes.
