*Defeating Nondeterminism in LLM Inference* (Horace He, Thinking Machines Lab)

> 

LLM 추론의 비결정론 문제 해결. 그리고 그를 통해 학습과 추론의 결과를 완전히 일치시킴. RL 프레임워크를 만들어봤다면 누구나 꿔봤을 꿈.

Resolving nondeterminism in LLM inference. Bitwise identical results between training and inference...a dream anyone would have had if they tried to make an RL framework.
