*h1: Bootstrapping LLMs to Reason over Longer Horizons via Reinforcement Learning* (Sumeet Ramesh Motwani, Alesia Ivanova, Ziyang Cai, Philip Torr, Riashat Islam, Shital Shah, Christian Schroeder de Witt, Charles London)

> Large language models excel at short-horizon reasoning tasks, but performance drops as reasoning horizon lengths increase. Existing approaches to combat this rely on inference-time scaffolding or costly step-level supervision, neither of which scales easily. In this work, we introduce a scalable method to bootstrap long-horizon reasoning capabilities using only existing, abundant short-horizon data. Our approach synthetically composes simple problems into complex, multi-step dependency chains of arbitrary length. We train models on this data using outcome-only rewards under a curriculum that automatically increases in complexity, allowing RL training to be scaled much further without saturating. Empirically, our method generalizes remarkably well: curriculum training on composed 6th-grade level math problems (GSM8K) boosts accuracy on longer, competition-level benchmarks (GSM-Symbolic, MATH-500, AIME) by up to 2.06x. Importantly, our long-horizon improvements are significantly higher than baselines even at high pass@k, showing that models can learn new reasoning paths under RL. Theoretically, we show that curriculum RL with outcome rewards achieves an exponential improvement in sample complexity over full-horizon training, providing training signal comparable to dense supervision. h1 therefore introduces an efficient path towards scaling RL for long-horizon problems using only existing data.

부분 문제들의 결합에 대해 학습시키면 자명하게 분해할 수 없는 문제들에 대해서도 일반화가 가능할까? 어쩌면.

Training on chain of atomic problems could generalize to reasoning on problems that cannot be trivially decomposed? Maybe!
